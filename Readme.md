# **GeoSheaf: A Sheaf-Theoretic Framework for Seismic-Well Integration**

## **Overview**
GeoSheaf is an advanced mathematical framework that integrates seismic reflection amplitudes and well log data using **sheaf theory** and **graph-based models**. This repository provides a novel approach to **reservoir characterization**, ensuring consistent, high-fidelity integration of multi-source geophysical data.
Understanding what‚Äôs underground is like having two different treasure maps‚Äîone shows big underground features (seismic data) but is blurry, and the other has detailed locations of treasure chests (well data) but doesn‚Äôt always match the first map. This research uses sheaf theory, a special kind of math, to combine these two maps perfectly, making sure everything lines up. By treating seismic reflections and well log measurements as connected pieces in a graph, this method explicitly fills in missing details and corrects errors, just like a detective solving a puzzle. This approach helps scientists find oil and gas more accurately, avoid mistakes, and make better predictions about what‚Äôs beneath the surface. Through advanced data integration techniques, including graph Laplacian-based solvers, this research provides a stronger, more reliable way to analyze the underground world, improving decision-making in the oil and gas industry. üöÄ
